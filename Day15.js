// 15. What's the output?

function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

sum(1, "2");

// A: NaN
// B: TypeError
// C: "12"
// D: 3

// Answer: C
// JavaScript is a dynamically typed language: we don't specify what types certain variables are.
// Values can automatically be converted into another type without you knowing, which is called implicit type coercion. Coercion is converting from one type into another.

// In this example, JavaScript converts the number 1 into a string, in order for the function to make sense and return a value.
// During the addition of a numeric type (1) and a string type ('2'), the number is treated as a string. We can concatenate strings like "Hello" + "World", so what's happening here is "1" + "2" which returns "12".
